        My Journey in Programming began when I was 20 years old, when I studied web system in my
        diploma program at Institute Computer Japan in Osaka. In addition, I learned HTML and CSS
        from Youtube. After Learning these skills, I set out to create a fun project for myself
      </p>
      <p className='mt-4 text-xl font-medium leading-8 tracking-tight'>
        At that time, I was not very serious about it, but then I realized I needed to take it
        seriously and also learn other programming language.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-4 text-xl font-medium leading-8 tracking-tight'>
        So, I have taken a more serious path to my programming journey by enrolling in Zero To
        Mastery Academy (The Complete Web Developer in 2024: Zero to Mastery course)
      </p>
      <p className='mt-4 text-xl font-medium leading-8 tracking-tight'>
        In my spare time, I moderate a Japanese community called Artificial Intelligence Japan,
        which my friends invited me to.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-4 text-xl font-medium leading-8 tracking-tight'>
        With knowledge under my belt, I went on to learn new languages, actively participating in
        community moderation, and eventually creating my own projects. In the future, I hope to
        contribute to open source projects.
